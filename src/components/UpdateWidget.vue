 * the firmware panel (facts, the update check, install), so the whole update
 * flow lives one click from the version rather than buried in settings.
 *
 * An install is followed all the way through, not just up to the last byte:
 * download, upload, the device writing on its own, the reboot, and the console
 * finding it again. See Phase below for why.
 *
 * The check runs in the browser, never on the device: a KVM sits on networks
